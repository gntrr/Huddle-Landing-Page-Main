### What I learned

This is the recap of some of your major learnings while working through this project. I've learned how to make a landmarks and aria role of all section on html where the example is showed below:

```html
<!-- Header Section -->
      <section class="logo" aria-label="Header Section">
          <img src="./images/logo.svg" alt="Huddle Logo">
      </section>
```
<div class="main-image" role="img" aria-label="Huddle Mockups">
  <img src="./images/illustration-mockups.svg" alt="Huddle Mockups">
</div>
```

### Continued development

For further development, i will focus on building custom styling for two devices, perhaps learning how to create different image backgrounds with different styles on mobile and desktop. It is possible that I will learn and use frameworks for future challenges, such as Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, and others.
